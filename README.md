## Overview

Solo Station is a revolutionary approach to robotic AI development that standardizes the physical environment for data collection and inference. By creating a consistent, reproducible 3D-printed station, Solo Station enables:

- **Consistent Data Collection**: Eliminate environmental variables across different robots
- **Platform Agnostic**: Works with diverse robotic systems and configurations
- **Reproducible Results**: Standardized setup ensures reliable, repeatable experiments
- **Easy Deployment**: 3D-printable design for rapid prototyping and scaling

## Key Features

### Standardized Physical Environment
- Precisely engineered 3D-printed components ensure identical setup across locations
- Calibrated sensor mounting positions for consistent data capture
- Modular design for easy customization and maintenance

### Multi-Robot Compatibility
- Universal mounting system supports various robotic platforms
- Flexible sensor integration for different AI models
- Scalable architecture from single robots to fleet deployment

### AI-Optimized Data Collection
- Purpose-built for machine learning workflows
- Consistent environmental conditions for training and inference
- Streamlined data pipeline integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- 3D printer (recommended: 200mm x 200mm x 200mm build volume or larger)
- Standard PLA or PETG filament
- Basic assembly tools

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solo-station.git
cd solo-station
```

2. Print the components using the provided STL files (coming soon)

3. Follow the assembly guide in the documentation

## Use Cases

- **Research**: Standardize experiments across multiple labs and institutions
- **Development**: Consistent environment for training and testing AI models
- **Production**: Deploy reliable inference stations across distributed locations
- **Education**: Reproducible setup for teaching robotics and AI concepts

## Supported Robots

Solo Station supports a wide variety of robot platforms from [robotsthatexist.com](https://robotsthatexist.com) and beyond:

- **Manipulators**: Robot arms and manipulation platforms
- **Mobile Robots**: Wheeled and tracked ground robots
- **Humanoids**: Full-body and upper-torso platforms
- **Hands**: Dexterous manipulation and multi-fingered hands
- **Grippers**: End-effectors and grasping mechanisms
- **Quadrupeds**: Four-legged dynamic platforms

Each robot category includes ready-to-use integration modules with mounting adapters, calibration files, and example code. See the [`modules/`](modules/) directory for details.
