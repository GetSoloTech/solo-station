# Quadruped Robot Modules

Four-legged robot platform integrations for Solo Station.

## Available Modules

### Research Platforms
- **Unitree Go1**: Agile quadruped robot (coming soon)
- **ANYmal**: Advanced legged platform (coming soon)

### Open Source
- **OpenQuadruped**: DIY quadruped builds (coming soon)

## Common Features

All quadruped modules include:
- Body mounting solutions
- Dynamic stabilization configurations
- Multi-camera positioning
- Terrain-aware workspace definitions
- Locomotion data collection

## Use Cases

- Locomotion learning
- Rough terrain navigation
- Dynamic manipulation
- Legged mobility research

## Mounting Considerations

Quadruped robots require special attention to:
- Center of mass preservation
- Dynamic balance during motion
- Sensor protection from impacts
- Cable management for movement

## Quick Start

1. Select your quadruped platform
2. Print body-mounted sensor bracket
3. Install cameras for terrain/task observation
4. Configure dynamic workspace boundaries
5. Collect locomotion and task data

## Safety

- Test with robot tethered initially
- Use padded workspace for falls
- Start with slow gaits
- Monitor battery levels
- Emergency stop always accessible
