# Humanoid Robot Modules

Humanoid platform integrations for Solo Station.

## Available Modules

### Research Humanoids
- **Custom Humanoid**: Template for humanoid platforms

### Upper Body
- **Bimanual Torsos**: Dual-arm upper body platforms (coming soon)

## Common Features

All humanoid modules include:
- Full-body or torso mounting solutions
- Multi-sensor calibration (cameras, IMUs)
- Bimanual task configurations
- Balance and stability considerations
- Complex manipulation examples

## Use Cases

- Bimanual manipulation
- Human-robot interaction
- Whole-body control
- Social robotics research

## Complexity Considerations

Humanoid platforms require:
- Multiple coordinated sensors
- Careful workspace design
- Balance during manipulation
- Increased calibration time

## Quick Start

1. Select humanoid platform
2. Print mounting brackets for torso/base
3. Install multi-camera system
4. Calibrate full workspace
5. Define bimanual or whole-body tasks
6. Collect coordinated manipulation data

## Safety

- Ensure stable base/mounting
- Test single-arm before bimanual
- Monitor joint limits carefully
- Use collaborative robot modes if available
